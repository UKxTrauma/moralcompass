python text-based game

Please be aware that the following game may produce ASCII art of blood and contain mild sexual innuendo and violence.

Copy and paste this code in to a Python file in Visual Studio Code and then run it to get started.
On the first instance of entering your name, enter Secret Game as your name to play a different game solely coded by me (work in progress).
